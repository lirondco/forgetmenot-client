## Summary

The goal of this app is to help people like me who have memory lapses and need a way to organise thoughts and ideas without the time constraint of a calendar or the chaos of an iPhone's note app. It's designed to be simple and easy to use. It is also a flexible app. Though personally I'd use it to record spontaneous thoughts and ideas that enter my mind when doing something else, one test user told me that they used it to help them with shopping for a recipe and then listing things they find interesting at the store that they did not want to purches at the time.

## How to use

# Home Page
![Home page screenshot](/screenshots/homepage.png "Home Page")

This is the page that you see when you first open the app. If you are a test user, a test set of credentials can be found in the "About" page. 

# User log in
![Log in screenshot](/screenshots/login.png "User login page")

This is the log-in page where a user enters their valid credentials. 

# Register user
![Registration screenshot](/screenshots/register.png "registration page")

This is the registration page for new users.

# New user's empty list page
![empty list page screenshot](/screenshots/freshlist.png "empty list for new users page")

New users will not have any lists for their ideas, so they see a blank page with two buttons for making an idea and a list. A user must make a list first before making an idea. If a user makes an idea without a list, they will be prompted with a link to create a new list.

# List Form
![add list form](/screenshots/addlist.png "new list form")

This is the form that users see when they're creating a new list. 

# Empty List
![empty list page](/screenshots/emptylist.png "empty list page")

When a list is first created, it will not contain any idea. This is how an empty list page will look like.

# New Idea Form
![new idea form](/screenshots/addidea.png "new idea form")

This is a form for creating a new idea.

# Ideas Page
![idea page](/screenshots/idea.png "idea page")

This is how a list with an idea will look like.

![expanded idea](/screenshots/expandedidea.png "expanded idea")

And this is how it looks like if an idea is clicked.

# Delete Function

You can delete an idea and a list by clicking on the delete button. Please note that deletion is irreversible.
